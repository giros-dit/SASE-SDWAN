Creating a README for your VNX SD-WAN and SASE Scenario project involves summarizing the project's purpose, structure, and instructions for setup and usage. Below is a template you can use and customize based on your specific requirements and additional details you might want to include.
VNX SD-WAN and SASE Scenario
Overview

This project provides a comprehensive simulation environment for a Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) scenario, integrating Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) technologies and remote work models. Built using the Virtual Networks over Linux (VNX) framework, it enables the deployment and testing of advanced network configurations, including virtualized network functions, edge computing, and integrated security services.
Features

    SD-WAN Simulation: Demonstrates the setup and management of a software-defined wide area network, offering insights into network optimization, application routing, and bandwidth management.
    SASE Model Integration: Integrates Secure Access Service Edge components, blending network and security functions to support dynamic, secure access to organizational resources.
    Remote Work Connectivity: Simulates remote work scenarios, showcasing how employees can securely connect to corporate resources from any location.
    Advanced Network Configurations: Utilizes Open vSwitch and VXLAN for network virtualization, alongside detailed routing and NAT configurations for realistic network topology simulation.

Prerequisites

    Linux environment with support for LXC (Linux Containers).
    VNX Framework installed and properly configured (VNX Installation Guide).
    Basic understanding of networking concepts, SD-WAN, and SASE architectures.

Installation

    Clone the Repository:
        git clone [repository-url]
        Navigate to the project directory: cd [project-directory]

    Load the Scenario:
        Ensure the VNX daemon is running: sudo vnx -v --daemon
        Load the scenario: sudo vnx -f [scenario-file].xml --create

    Start the Simulation:
        Execute the start command: sudo vnx -f [scenario-file].xml --start

Configuration Details

This scenario includes multiple components:

    LAN and WAN Networks: Configured as virtual bridges and veth pairs for interconnectivity.
    Host VMs (h11, h21, etc.): Simulate end-user devices within the network.
    Router VMs (r1, r2, etc.): Facilitate routing between different network segments.
    SD-WAN Edge Devices (sdedge1, sdedge2, etc.): Implement SD-WAN functionalities.
    NAT Devices (nat1, nat2, etc.): Provide Internet connectivity and simulate external network access.
    ISP: Simulates Internet Service Provider for the scenario.

Usage

Once the scenario is loaded and started, you can interact with each component using VNX commands or directly accessing the Linux Containers via lxc-attach. For specific interactions or to simulate network changes, refer to the VNX documentation.
Troubleshooting

    Ensure all prerequisites are met and that VNX is correctly installed.
    Verify network configurations and interconnectivity between VMs if you encounter connectivity issues.
    Consult the VNX documentation for common issues and troubleshooting tips.
